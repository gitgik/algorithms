    "Example:\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "Notice that if the clue array contains only consecutive +ves, we can return original sequence of `[0, 1,..,N]`. Similarly, if it contains only consecutive -ves, we return the sequence reversed (to produce decreasing run of numbers).\n",
    "For example, given `[None, +, -, -, -]` we reverse the last 3 entries of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` to become `[0, 1, 4, 3, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this little trick to more complicated inputs. We can use a stack to keep track of numbers to be reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we traverse the clues input array, we keep track of the corresponding elements of the original sequence. \n",
    "- For consecutive positive signs, keep the elements of the original sequence.\n",
    "- For consecutive negative signs, push those elements onto stack. When we come to the end of negatives run, pop elements off one by one to get a decreasing subsequence in our answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since there are fewer + or - sign than elements in our answer, we will add the last element to the stack.\n",
    "We finally empty the stack one by one, appending to our answer."
